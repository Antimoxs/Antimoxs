# **Haii! I am Antimoxs and welcome to my GitHub!**
I mainly code in Java but also have basic knowledge in Python, JavaScript, Html, Vue.js/Nuxt.js and Css/Sass. It all started a few years ago with my very own Discord bot in Java which is still running today and extending Discords functions with some very useful features (https://tbcbot.page.link/invite). Since then I've been improving my Java skills and now working on some more projects besides my bot. I also started to get my head through web-developing via Nuxt.

## What I am currently working on:

### Blaubart.net
Working on this lil baby <3 it's gonna be great.

### Discord Bot
As mentioned above, I have my own Discord bot which is providing a range of features to make my life easier. It's coded in Java and nearly safe coded so even idiots can use it. My plans for the future are a complete recode of the old structure since a lot of it is still from the beginning when i started with Java and its neither very clean nor easy to expand.
